# EDD-FinalProject
Final Project for college class preforming DS-Workflow on Spotify data set
This Project was completed as a 4 person team and would not be possible without the contribution of my teamates Brahim Nid-Youssef, Christino L Barbosa, and Enrique Reyes.
For this project, we formed a use-case, hypothesized, cleaned, analyzed, and concluded based on the Spotify data set given to us by our professor.
In summary, we explored the relationship of a song's duration and danceability to wether or not it was a "Hit."
This project was done on Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks in it's entirety.
The finalized project is included in the HTML file, the presentation is included in the pptx file, and the raw code is included in the ipynb file.
